# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is one of the most played games and is the best time killer game that you can play anywhere with just a pen and paper. But his project brings that fun out on your computer. If you don’t know how to play this game don’t worry let us first understand that.

Tic-tac-toe is a two player game (one of them is either your computer or someone playing the game with you). The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The player who first gets 3 of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other loses the game.
